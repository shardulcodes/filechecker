delta(q1,1)

if you're in state q1 ad read 1

write 0
move right
go to state q2

turing machine is a 7 tuple

Q: set of states
Sigma: Input alphabet(what symbols that can appear inn the input)

r : tape alphabet (symbols that can appear on the tape)

delta: transition function

q0 : start state
q_accept: accepting state
q_reject: rejecting state


Solvable Problems
->A turing machine will always halt and give the correct answer : either YES or NO
-> A language is called recursive if there exists a Turing Machine which always halts and accepts or rejects strings in that language

Semi Solvable Problems
-> The Turing Machine halts and says YES, if the answer is YES.
-> But if answer is NO, Run forever or halt and say NO(but not guaranteed)
->only work for some inputs and not all
